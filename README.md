# Clock-Digital-JS
This project is a responsive digital clock web application built with HTML5, JavaScript (ES6), and Bootstrap for styling. The clock displays the current time based on your server’s time by fetching a server time value from a configurable endpoint. If the server time cannot be retrieved, the clock gracefully falls back to using the client’s time.
